**📍 Venue:** Presidency University, Bengaluru  
**📅 Date:** 13th–14th September 2024

I had the opportunity to participate in **PAC HACK 2024**, where we worked as a team to develop a socially impactful project titled [**Impact Bridge**](https://github.com/hrishi-6887/Impact-bridge). The goal was to bridge the gap between NGOs and philanthropists focused on eradicating poverty — aligned with **UN Sustainable Development Goal 1 (SDG-1)**.

### 🛠️ Project: Impact Bridge

### 🔍 Highlights:
- Built a fully functional Java-based web app in 24 hours
- Designed database schema to manage NGO requests and donation tracking
- Divided team responsibilities across backend, frontend, and database integration
- Presented the solution to mentors and evaluators with a working demo
